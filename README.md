# Formula 1 Dataset Analysis

This project contains a Power BI dashboard built on top of SQL queries to showcase statistics and historical trends in Formula 1. The goal was to visualize key data on top drivers, constructors and interesting facts, which helped me increase my knowledge in the world of F1.

Original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data).

### Project Structure
- Data for Visualizations: Contains the csv files I exported from the SQL queries

- F1.pbix: Power BI dashboard

### Dashboard Structure
- Facts: Interesting historical facts of F1
